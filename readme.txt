Easy Footnotes lets you quickly and easily add footnotes throughout your WordPress posts using a simple shortcode in the text editor.

== Description ==

Easy Footnotes lets you add footnotes throughout your WordPress posts by using the shortcode [efn_note]Footnote content.[/efn_note]. Easy Footnotes will automatically add the number of the footnote where the shortcode was entered and add the full footnote text to the bottom of your post in an ordered list with a corresponding number.

Hovering the footnote label will show the user the full text of the footnote using the jQuery Qtip2 plugin. Clicking on the footnote label will take the user down the page to the corresponding footnote at the bottom of the WordPress post. Each footnote at the bottom of the post has a icon that can be clicked to return to that particular footnote within the post copy.

That's all it takes to start adding footnotes to your WordPress blog!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'easy-footnotes' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it! Now simply start using the [efn_note]Footnote content goes here.[/efn_note] shortcode within your posts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I insert a footnote into my post. =

Simply use the shortcode [efn_note]Footnote content goes here[/efn_note] and Easy Footnotes will enter numeric footnotes into your post that open on hover and take the user to the footnote at the bottom of the page on click.

= That's awesome! =

I know, but that's not really a question.

= Oh right, why is that so awesome? =

Because it's easy. And it's integrated with the qTip2 jQuery plugin to display your footnotes in lovely tooltips on hover. Plus it automatically numbers your footnotes in the order you enter them into your post.

= How can I change the markup for the footnote label? =

Just use the `efn_footnote_label` filter in your functions.php to edit the output.

<pre>
<code>function efn_change_label_markup( $output, $label ) {
    return '<h5>' . $label . '</h5>';
}
add_filter( 'efn_footnote_label', 'efn_change_label_markup', 10, 2 );</code>
</pre>

= Can I disable the qTip functionality? =

Place the following code in your functions.php file to disable the qTip features.

<pre>
<code>function efn_deregister_scripts() {
	wp_deregister_style( 'qtipstyles' );
	wp_deregister_script( 'imagesloaded' );
	wp_deregister_script( 'qtip' );
	wp_deregister_script( 'qtipcall' );
}
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'efn_deregister_scripts' );</code>
</pre>

= How can I reset the footnote count? =

Use on the beginning of your page with the short code: `[efn_reset][/efn_reset]`

This is a hard reset to fix a bug with themes/plugins using `do_shortcode( get_the_content() )` outside the main loop and causing duplicate footnotes. 1.1.9 should have updates to not require this.

== Screenshots ==

1. Displaying a footnote on hover.
2. Several footnotes (feetnote?) at the bottom of the post.
